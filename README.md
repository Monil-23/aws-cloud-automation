# üöÄ AWS Infrastructure Automation ‚Äì Cloud Deployment with SNS, S3, EC2, and RDS

This project demonstrates the automation of a full-stack cloud-native application environment using AWS CLI, Shell scripts, and Python (Boto3 SDK). It showcases the creation and teardown of a multi-resource AWS environment along with automated testing (grading) scripts.

- **AWS CLI & Services**: EC2, RDS, S3, SNS, ELB, IAM
- **Shell Scripting**: Environment setup, deployment, teardown
- **Python Boto3 SDK**: Validation and grading automation
- **Node.js / NPM**: SNS integration through app logic
- **Auto-scaling & Load Balancing**
- **PM2**: Node process manager (for app resilience)
